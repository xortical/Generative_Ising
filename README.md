# Generative_Ising
A Work in progress to create a generative model based on Ising Model. 2D Ising models show phase transitions and are incredibly good at creating clumpy islands. 2D Ising models are used to study the evolution of domains of ferromagnetic materials. I believe this is the ideal model to use to generate creatures in cellular automata. The goal is to have AI generate structures (imagine gliders, oscillators and spaceships in Conway's Game of Life).
